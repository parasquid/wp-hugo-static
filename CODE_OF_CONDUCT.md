# Contributor Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Ruby Community Conduct Guideline](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/conduct/).

We have picked the following conduct guideline for the wp-hugo-static community for safe, productive collaboration.

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive, and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to the wp-hugo-static project. It applies to all "collaborative spaces", which are defined as community communications channels (such as GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, mailing lists, submitted patches, commit comments, etc.).

## Guidelines

1. **Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.**

2. **Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.**

3. **When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.**

4. **Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.**

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Ruby Community Conduct Guideline](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/conduct/), which was based on an early proposed draft of the PostgreSQL Code of Conduct.
